# OLA--Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of ride data from an Ola Database. Using SQL and Power BI, I answered key business and operational questions to uncover insights about booking patterns, customer behavior, ride performance, and driver ratings. The project also includes a Power BI dashboard for effective data visualization and storytelling.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to analyze ride data to:
1. Understand ride patterns, cancellations, ratings, and revenue.
2. Identify ways to improve operations and enhance customer and driver satisfaction.
3. Present findings clearly using a Power BI dashboard.

## Project Deliverables
### SQL Analysis
I solved 10 SQL questions to derive insights from the Ola Database. Key queries include:
1. Retrieve all successful bookings.
2. Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type.
3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers.
4. List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides.
5. Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues.
6. Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings.
7. Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI.
8. Find the average customer rating per vehicle type.
9. Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully.
10. List all incomplete rides along with the reason.

The SQL queries were executed on the dataset to generate insights and support business questions.

### Power BI Analysis
I created a Power BI dashboard to visualize the ride data and answer key business questions:
1. Ride Volume Over Time.
2. Booking Status Breakdown.
3. Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance.
4. Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type.
5. Cancelled Rides Reasons.
6. Revenue by Payment Method.
7. Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value.
8. Ride Distance Distribution Per Day.
9. Driver Ratings Distribution.
10. Customer vs. Driver Ratings.

### Power BI Dashboard
The interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the data. It helps in:
1. Tracking ride volume trends and cancellation patterns.
2. Understanding customer and driver satisfaction through ratings.
3. Analyzing revenue distribution by payment methods.

## Technologies Used
1. SQL: Data retrieval and analysis.
2. Power BI: Visualization and dashboard creation.
3. PostgreSQL: Database for running SQL queries.
4. Microsoft Excel: Data preparation and cleaning.

## Insights and Findings
### Key SQL Insights:
1. The average ride distance is highest for Prime Sedan and lowest for Auto.
2. Cancellations by drivers due to personal and car-related issues account for a significant proportion of all driver cancellations.
3. Top 5 customers contribute significantly to total ride volume, indicating strong loyalty or high-frequency users.
### Key Power BI Insights:
1. Ride Volume Trends: Ride volumes peak during weekends and evenings.
2. Revenue Insights: UPI and Cash are the most used payment methods, driving the majority of revenue.
3. Cancellation Reasons: Most customer cancellations occur due to "Driver is not moving towards pickup location", while most driver cancellations are due to "Personal & Car-related Issues".

## How to Use
